# Getting Started

## Motivation 
Ultimately, all actions run on a computer come from some interface that calls functions. Dragging and dropping file will have an equivalent copy command that could be called via a command line interface.

Terminal is a command line interface (application for execute commands via text) for executing a lot of our commands. It is a program that lets us interact with our computer in very fundmanetal ways. Most development will come back to a terminal. Even if we interact with our programs with other UIs, terminal commands are the most direct ways to diagnose problems.
