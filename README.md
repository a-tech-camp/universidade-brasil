# Welcome
Welcome to the Course. This is the first lesson. It opens up a bunch of other lessons along with it. 

Let’s talk about the software journey. These steps will come up again again. That is, not only will you go through them as you learn coding, but you will also go through them when you learn any new coding tool. Here are the steps:

First, we need to demystify the code. We will help you edit small bits of code and see the changes. For example, given a program that displays “Hello World” you will edit it display “Hello” followed by your name. The important thing to do is to go from thinking that technology magically happens and realize that it happens because a file tells it to happen.

Second, comes the big struggle. Here you will encounter errors in your code also known as bugs. These bugs can be small like missing characters in the file, or big like missing programs on your computer. These problems will be very frustrating, and at times it will feel like you are still on the first step. The key here is to understand the code needs to be executed in a context. This context is what allows the file to be interpreted correctly. As such, all code is always part of a larger context. The python file you write will exist in the context of the python interpreter you have locally installed. The python interpreter exists in the context of the operating system of the computer. The operating system exists in the context of the hardware that executes the code. Often it is important to check your assumptions. Within the context of these lessons, that means going back to previous lessons. Within the context of coding in general, it means step back until you have something small and working.

Third, will come decisions on tradeoff. You will start to see multiple ways of coding a solution. More importantly, solutions to various parts of the problem will interact and you will start to see tradeoffs between one solution and another. Good software engineers are able to consider these various trade-offs and choose a good one. Some of these tradeoffs can even 

Fourth, you will start to focus on paradigms. Different paradigms will work well together. Some paradigms will not work well together.

These stages should help give some context on where you may be in your coding journey. Hope they help. 

The next steps from here will give you some more context on what coding is and how it is done.
